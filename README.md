Next.js internationalization playground

## Strategies

- **Cookie**
- **Query**
- **URL**

## `<Link/>`

> [!WARNING]
> There are some noticeable navigation quirks where some links stop working from time to time. The
> community [claims](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/57565) it is related to prefetching, therefore
> prefetch will be disabled all together. MONITOR THIS ISSUE TO RE-ENABLE IF FIXED.

> [!TIP]
> Link has a slightly asymmetric behaviour with `defaultLanguage`. When the current language is different from the
> default all links will also include the default. This is needed and cannot be disabled.
>
> This is to solve: When a user has a cookie set to a locale (like `gr`) visiting an un-prefixed url `/article` will
> yield to a `/gr/article` redirect rather than displaying the `/article` page (in `en`) this is the expected behaviour
> unless someone is visiting `/article` to intentionally change language. Therefore, links will link to `/en/article` to
> intentionally force a language switch redirect. This prefixing will be disabled if the current locale is already `en`,
> to prevent redirects during same-language navigation on the `defaultLocale`.

## Deploy

Use wrangler to create a new project using

```shell
wrangler pages project create svara-test-i18n --production-branch main --compatibility-date 2025-01-15 --compatibility-flag nodejs_compat
```

And proceed to configure the account and paths in the final parts of
the [deployment pipeline](.github/workflows/publish.yml)

## Todo

- ✅ Migrate to [wrangler-action](https://github.com/cloudflare/pages-action)
- Add hreflang to query pages
- ✅ Add style to Markdown
